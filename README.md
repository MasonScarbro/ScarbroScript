A Comprehensive Overview of My Programming Language
My programming language is an evolution of Jlox, with numerous enhancements and additional features. While it maintains the core principles of Jlox, it introduces several new concepts and functionalities, making it a versatile and powerful language.

Core Features
1. Syntax Enhancements
Break Statements: Support for break statements enables easier control flow within loops and switch statements.
Multiline Comments: Added support for multiline comments using /* */, enhancing code readability.
2. Advanced Data Structures
Arrays: Arrays are introduced as a versatile data structure, akin to lists, supporting dynamic sizing and mixed element types.
List Operations: Added array manipulation functions like set, get, and add for efficient data handling.
3. Built-in Modules
Math Module: In-house modules like Math provide access to mathematical functions for complex computations.
IO Module: Provides IO functionalities for input/output operations, enhancing interaction with the environment.
4. Object Instance Functions
String Methods: String instances support various methods like substring(), enhancing string manipulation capabilities.
Array Methods: Array instances support methods like append() for efficient array manipulation.
5. Modern Language Features
Classes and Functions: Support for defining classes and functions facilitates structured programming.
Prefix Increment/Decrement Operators: Modern operators like ++ and -- are supported for convenience and readability.
Is Keyword: Borrowed from C#, the is keyword enhances type-checking capabilities.
6. Context-Based Features
Exists Keyword: Introduced the exists keyword to check the existence of previous items within context, aiding in data structure manipulation and error handling.
