A Programming Language Im in The Middle Of Writing,
Whilst Bare bones this is basically the C-sharp version of Jlox, Although with a very few differences
Additions to Jlox include:
* break  statements (challenge)
* a /* multiline comment (challenge)
* and Decrement and Increment operators --var and ++var, which was not a book challenge
* I hope to continue working on the language and add more built in functions 
Missing from Jlox include:
* OOP classes 

Yes I did not include OOP even though I really enjoy OOP, I read the chapters to make sure I wasnt missing important informaion but just decided against it.
